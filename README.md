# zemasterplan

In the style of Awesome Lists.
The somewhat personal collection of ramblings and info-dumps of research material I am accumulating through my planning stage [clarify]

I should probably use Notion but this allows more freedom and collaboration w my coworker and so on.

# Things in the Agenda
1. Figure out what to include
2. Start listing various resources we already have
3. Figure out some sort of display mode - graphic aspect - possibly web/pages
4. ???
5. Profit
